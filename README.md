# JEFUScores
This is an Android app to keep scores on an Americal Football game.  

The app makes it easy to keep scores, even on Junior League, where the goal scores might differ from the adult's games.
In the Settings tab, you can tell the app, how many points you get from a Goal and how much from an additional Goal
(as this might differ, depending on the series).

The app shows the current game score in a visually easy way: current score is always seen, as well as the goal log
of each team.

This app was originally developed for the need of following Finnish Junior League games, so unfortunately no localisation
to English language as of yet!

Properties:
- the app stores each completed game to an internal SQLite (Room) database (no need for any extra software for this - 
the application works as it is)
- old games can be viewed and deleted
- stored gamelogs can be selected in the app to be sent via email to max. 5 email addresses
